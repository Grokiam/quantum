# Quantum
# Created March 13, 2019
# Some day I want to at least run a simple pogram on the D-Wave Quantum Computer
# Then try something tricky
# In April 2019 I tried to install Python on my home PC and load the DWave OCEAN simulator.  I was able to install Python and test a simple program. I downloaded the ocean code and installed and ran a classical example from the Ocean site, but could not get all the libraries for or something was causing a Windows security issue that I coulsd not resolve
# ITA Godwin suggested I try getting a Googel Cloud virtual machine with Python pre-installed.
# Dec 28 starting project to try to run Ocean in a Googel Cloud Shell
# Dec 30 have library incompatibility with numpy, dwave want <1.16 tensorflow (in GCloud) wants > 1.17
